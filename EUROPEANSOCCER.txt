Sample Data:
INSERT INTO leagues (league_name, country, founded_year) VALUES
  ('Premier League', 'England', 1992),
  ('La Liga', 'Spain', 1929),
  ('Bundesliga', 'Germany', 1963);

INSERT INTO teams (team_name, league_id, country) VALUES
  ('Manchester United', 1, 'England'),
  ('Barcelona', 2, 'Spain'),
  ('Bayern Munich', 3, 'Germany');

INSERT INTO matches (date, home_team_id, away_team_id, home_team_score, away_team_score, league_id) VALUES
  ('2023-04-23', 1, 2, 1, 2, 1),
  ('2023-04-24', 2, 3, 0, 3, 2),
  ('2023-04-25', 1, 3, 2, 0, 3);

INSERT INTO players (player_name, team_id, position) VALUES
  ('Lionel Messi', 2, 'Forward'),
  ('Robert Lewandowski', 3, 'Forward'),
  ('Paul Pogba', 1, 'Midfielder');
 RESULTS:
1)Get the total number of goals scored by a specific team in a specific league:
 SELECT SUM(home_team_score + away_team_score) AS total_goals
 FROM matches
 WHERE league_id = 1 AND (home_team_id = 1 OR away_team_id = 1);
2)Get the number of matches won by a specific team in a specific league:
 SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_wins
 FROM matches
 WHERE league_id = 2 AND (home_team_id = 2 OR away_team_id = 2) AND (home_team_id = 2 AND home_team_score > away_team_score OR away_team_id = 2 AND away_team_score > home_team_score);
3)Get the top 5 players with the most goals scored:
  SELECT player_name, COUNT(*) AS total_goals
FROM players JOIN matches ON players.team_id = matches.home_team_id OR players.team_id = matches.away_team_id
WHERE position = 'Forward'
GROUP BY player_name
ORDER BY total_goals DESC
LIMIT 5;
